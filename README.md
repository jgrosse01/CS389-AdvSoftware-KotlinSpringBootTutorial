# CS389-AdvSoftware-KotlinSpringBootTutorial

My code from following a Java/Springboot tutorial put together by professor Nate Williams made to get an initial grasp on the technologies at use. Link: https://github.com/YogoGit/SpringBootTutorial/blob/main/SpringBoot.md

This tutorial was follwed directly in a different repository. This repository shows the code I have written while translating the steps to Kotlin instead of typing directly in Java.

Project utilizes springboot to create a webapp using controllers, templates, services, and a database.
